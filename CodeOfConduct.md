The Chloe 280SE community exists to facilitate sharing information, resources and encouragement among its members.

We believe our mission is best served in an environment that is friendly, safe and accepting; free from intimidation or harassment.

Towards this end, certain behaviors and practices won't be tolerated.

# Scope
We expect all members of the Chloe 280SE community, including administrators, users, facilitators and vendors to abide by this code of conduct at all times in all Chloe 280SE community venues, online and in person, all public and private channels and in one-on-one communications pertaining to Chloe 280SE affairs.

This policy covers the usage of the Chloe 280SE [Telegram](https://t.me/chloe280seug), as well as the Chloe 280SE [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/chloe280se) and any Chloe 280SE related events.

This code of conduct is in addition to and doesn't in any way nullify or invalidate, any other terms or conditions related to use of Chloe 280SE.

The definitions of various subjective terms such as "discriminatory", "hateful", or "confusing" will be decided at the sole discretion of the Chloe 280SE administrators.

# Friendly, harassment-free space
We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics.

We ask that you respect that people have differences of opinion regarding technical choices and acknowledge that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a single right answer. A difference of technology preferences is never a license to be rude.

Everything shared in the Chloe 280SE community is under FrieNDA. All opinions, concerns, feelings, rants and viewpoints, whether about people, events, companies, or the tech industry, shared in this Telegram shouldn't be shared without the explicit (and enthusiastic) consent of the person who shared it. This includes sharing information without attributing it to the specific person who said it (for example "I heard in a Telegram channel I'm a part of that... "). In short, if the information is public knowledge (that is can be cited by a readily available online source), it's fine to share, but if you're quoting an individual's opinion, you must receive their permission first.

Any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or other attention-stealing behavior isn't welcome and won't be tolerated.

Harassing other Chloe 280SE users is never tolerated, whether using public or private media.

Avoid using offensive or harassing package names, nicknames, or other identifiers that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.

Harassment includes, but isn't limited to: harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments related to gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, physical appearance, body size, race, or similar personal characteristics; inappropriate use of nudity, sexual images and/or sexually explicit language in public spaces; threats of physical or non-physical harm; deliberate intimidation, stalking or following; harassing photography or recording; sustained disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact; and unwelcome sexual attention.

# Acceptable content
The Chloe 280SE administrators reserve the right to make judgement calls about what is and isn't appropriate in published content. These are guidelines to help you be successful in our community.

Content must contain something applicable to the previously stated goals of the Chloe 280SE community. "Spamming", that is, publishing any form of content that isn't applicable, isn't allowed.

Content mustn't contain illegal or infringing content. Only publish content to Chloe 280SE community if you have the right to do so. This includes complying with all software license agreements or other intellectual property restrictions. For example, redistributing an MIT-licensed module with the copyright notice removed, wouldn't be allowed. You will be responsible for any violation of laws or othersâ€™ intellectual property rights.

Content mustn't be malware. For example, content (code, video, pictures, words, etc.) which is designed to maliciously exploit or damage computer systems, isn't allowed.

Content name, description and other visible metadata mustn't include abusive, inappropriate, or harassing content.

# No solicitation
The Chloe 280SE community isn't meant to be a place to solicit new business.
To that end, direct, unsolicited pitching of a business, product, or service to other members, whether it be in a channel or Direct Message (DM) isn't allowed.
If you have a product or service related to the Chloe 280SE that you want to promote, contact an admin.

# Reporting violations of this code of conduct
If you believe someone is harassing you or has otherwise violated this code of conduct, contact any of the admins listed at the top of this document and send us an abuse report. If this is the initial report of a problem, include as much detail as possible. It is easiest for us to address issues when we have more context.

# Consequences
All content published to the Chloe 280SE community, including user account credentials, is hosted at the sole discretion of the Chloe 280SE administrators.

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors, employees, customers, or others with decision-making authority, won't be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the Chloe 280SE administrators may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event or service).

# Addressing grievances
If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, notify the Chloe 280SE admin team either by posting in #moderators or reaching out privately with a direct message to any of the admins listed at the top of this document.

We will do our best to ensure that your grievance is handled appropriately.

In general, we will choose the course of action that we judge as being most in the interest of fostering a safe and friendly community.

# Contact info
Contact any of the admins listed at the top of this document if you need to report a problem or address a grievance related to an abuse report.
