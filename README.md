# SE Basic IV

[SE Basic IV](https://cheveron.github.io/sebasic4/) is a free open-source BASIC interpreter for the Z80 architecture. Although it aims for a high degree of compatibility with Microsoft BASIC, there are some differences. SE Basic IV is designed to run on the [Chloe 280SE](https://www.patreon.com/chloe280se) but it is also compatible with Timex Sinclair models with 128K of RAM, esxDOS, Timex video modes and ULAplus. SE Basic IV runs plain text `.BAS` files. It implements floating-point arithmetic in the extended [Microsoft Binary Format](https://github.com/cheveron/sebasic4/wiki/Technical-reference#microsoft-binary-format-extended) (MBF) and can therefore read and write binary data files created by 6502 versions of Microsoft BASIC.
